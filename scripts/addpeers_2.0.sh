# This is a helper script for adding more peers to an already
# running tezos-node. It first queries for, and adds all
# foundation nodes, then queries tzscan's API for more peers and
# adds them as well.
# 
#
# The tezos-admin-client binary will output 'Error' messages in
# most cases, even when already connected to a peer.
#
# Be sure to install jq and configure the TZPATH variable below
# [yum|apt] install jq
#
# Assumptions: 
# - tezos commands must be in the users PATH directory
# - following commands are available on your system: dig (dnsutils package on debian), jq, curl
# - when using docker, install with:
#     docker exec -it name_of_your_container sudo apk add bind-tools jq curl bash
